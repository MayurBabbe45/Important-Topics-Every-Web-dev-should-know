Here are your interview notes on **n8n** (pronounced "n-eight-n").

While the previous topics were about *building* apps, n8n is about **automating** them. In a web development context, it is often used as a "Low-Code Backend" or "Glue Layer."

---

### 1. What is n8n?

**The "Elevator Pitch" Definition:**
n8n is a "fair-code" workflow automation tool. It allows you to connect different apps (like Google Sheets, Slack, Database, Custom APIs) together using a visual node-based editor.

**The Analogy:**

* **Zapier/Make:** These are like **public bus routes**. They are easy to use, but you have to follow their specific stops and pay per ride (per task).
* **n8n:** This is like **owning your own car**. You can drive wherever you want, customize the engine (write your own code), and if you self-host it, you don't pay per mile—you just pay for the gas (server cost).

### 2. How does it work? (The Architecture)

n8n is a **Node-Based** system.

1. **Workflow:** The entire map of your automation.
2. **Nodes:** Each step in the process is a "Node."
* **Trigger Node:** Starts the process (e.g., "On Webhook", "Every 5 minutes", "On Starred GitHub Repo").
* **Action Node:** Does something (e.g., "Send Email", "Insert into SQL").
* **Function/Code Node:** (Crucial for devs) Runs custom **JavaScript** to manipulate data.


3. **Data Flow:** Data is passed between nodes as **JSON objects**.

### 3. Why is it popular with Developers? (vs. Zapier)

If an interviewer asks *"Why use n8n instead of Zapier?"*, these are your key points:

* **Self-Hostable:** You can install n8n on your own server (Docker, AWS, DigitalOcean). This means **Data Privacy** (data never leaves your infrastructure) and **No "Per-Task" Fees**.
* **The "Code" Node:** Unlike other tools that hide the logic, n8n lets you write standard JavaScript. If a pre-built integration doesn't exist, you can just use the "HTTP Request" node and write the logic yourself.
* **Complex Logic:** It supports loops, merge logic, and if/else statements much better than competitors.

### 4. Use Cases in Web Development

You don't just use n8n for "marketing stuff." You use it as part of your tech stack:

1. **The "Invisible" Backend:**
* Instead of writing an entire Node.js Express server just to handle a "Contact Us" form, you point the form to an **n8n Webhook**.
* n8n receives the data -> Saves to Database -> Sends Slack Notification -> Replies to user.
* *Benefit:* Built in 10 minutes, zero maintenance.


2. **Cron Jobs (Scheduled Tasks):**
* "Every night at 12 AM, scrape this website and update our database."
* Doing this in standard code requires setting up a server, cron tabs, and error logging. n8n handles the timing and retries out of the box.


3. **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):**
* Rapidly prototyping backend logic before committing to writing 10,000 lines of code.



### 5. Efficient Use (Best Practices)

Just because it's visual doesn't mean it can't be inefficient.

* **Avoid "Polling":** Don't set n8n to check a database "every 1 minute" (inefficient). Use **Webhooks** (Real-time) whenever possible.
* **Error Handling:** n8n has "Error Trigger" nodes. Always set up a workflow that alerts you (via Slack/Email) if your main automation fails.
* **Keep it Clean:** Don't build a massive 100-node monster. Split complex logic into **Sub-Workflows** (like functions in code) to keep things readable.

### ⚠️ Common Interview Trap

**Interviewer:** "So, should we replace our entire backend with n8n?"
**You:** "No. n8n is great for asynchronous tasks, integrations, and internal tools. But for the core application logic (like high-frequency user interactions or complex business rules), a proper backend (Node.js/Python) is faster, more testable, and version-controllable."

### Quick Summary Table

| Feature | Zapier / Make | n8n |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Target Audience** | Business Users / Marketers | Developers / Technical Users |
| **Hosting** | Cloud Only (SaaS) | **Self-Hosted** (Docker) or Cloud |
| **Pricing** | Pay per "Task" (can get expensive) | Free (Self-hosted) or Monthly |
| **Custom Logic** | Limited | **Full JavaScript Support** |
| **Data Privacy** | Data goes through their servers | Data stays on your server |

### Next Step

This concludes the "Modern Web Tools" section of your prep. We have covered the **Browser** (Wasm/Workers), **Graphics** (WebGL/Canvas), and **Automation** (n8n).

To wrap up your technical prep, would you like to cover **"APIs & Communication"** (REST vs GraphQL vs WebSockets)? This is usually the final major technical pillar in web dev interviews.
